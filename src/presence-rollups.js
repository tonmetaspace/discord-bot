import EventEmitter from 'node:events';

// Data structure for tracking the series of arrivals/departures in a hub and rolling it up
// into a useful stream of notifications. When new arrivals or departures happen, either
// a new notification will be produced, or the most recent notification will be amended. If
// a user renames themselves rapidly after arriving, the arrival will be amended to have their
// new name.
//
// Fires two kinds of events:
// - "new", indicating that a new notification should be produced announcing the arrival or
//   departure of some set of users, or a rename of a user.
// - "update", indicating that the previous notification should be amended and whichever users
//   were announced in it should be replaced with the newly provided set of users.

  // pendingDepartures is keyed on name, not ID, and why it has an array of timeouts, instead of one.
